- From this course, I learned the basics of network troubleshooting commands, different network topologies, and key components such as switches, hubs, and routers. I also explored subnetting methods, fundamental networking protocols like SMTP, POP3, and MIME, as well as routing algorithms and the Domain Name System (DNS).
